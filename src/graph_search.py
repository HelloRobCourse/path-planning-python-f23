General graph search instructions:

First, define the correct data type to keep track of your visited cells
and add the start cell to it. If you need to initialize any properties
of the start cell, do that too.

Next, implement the graph search function. When you find a path, use the
trace_path() function to return a path given the goal cell and the graph. You
must have kept track of the parent of each node correctly and have implemented
the graph.get_parent() function for this to work. If you do not find a path,
return an empty list.

To visualize which cells are visited in the navigation webapp, save each
visited cell in the list in the graph class as follows:
     graph.visited_cells.append(Cell(cell_i, cell_j))
where cell_i and cell_j are the cell indices of the visited cell you want to
visualize.
